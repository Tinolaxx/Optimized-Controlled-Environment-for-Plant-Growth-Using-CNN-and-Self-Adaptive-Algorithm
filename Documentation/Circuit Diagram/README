Vin: 9V
- Peristaltic Pumps
- 12V Fan

5V:
- DHT11
- I2C LCD Display

3.3V:
- ESP8266 Wifi Module
- Capacitive Soil Moisture Sensor

Peristaltic Pump:
VCC = Connect to NC of Relay
GND = Connect to GND of Arduino and Power Supply

NOTE:
- Do not plug in ESP8266 or Soil Moisture Sensor in 5V or higher.
- Vin should be 9V only.
- PCB was originally used in the design.
- Vin is different from 5V. Do not put it in the same pins.
- GND of power supply can be mixed with GND of Arduino.

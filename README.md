# Optimized-Controlled-Environment-for-Plant-Growth-Using-CNN-and-Self-Adaptive-Algorithm

This study presents the development of aself-adaptive control system for plant growth within an optimizedcontrolled environment, integrating Convolutional NeuralNetworks (CNNs) and a Self-Adaptive Algorithm to enhanceresource efficiency and crop outcomes. The system incorporatesoptical spectrometry, morphological image processing, andmachine learning to regulate key environmental parameters suchas temperature, humidity, soil moisture, and light intensity whileassessing real-time plant health and development. Amicrocontroller-based sensor array captures environmental data,which is processed by the Self-Adaptive Algorithm to maintainoptimal growth conditions maintaining temperature (22–25 °C),humidity (70–80%), soil moisture (60–80%), and light intensity(18,900 lux). The CNN model, built on a pre-trained ResNet-50architecture, classifies plant growth stages using image-basedtechniques such as edge detection, background subtraction, andmorphological transformations. The model achieved 100%accuracy across all validation scenarios, supporting precise,data-driven growth monitoring. Results confirm that the systemreliably sustained favorable environmental conditions, validatedthrough normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) valuesand consistent sensor outputs. The integration of deep learningwith adaptive environmental control demonstrates strongpotential for transforming precision agriculture, enablingsustainable and scalable crop management strategies.
